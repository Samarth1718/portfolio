              An assumption is something that is taken as the truth without attempting to check for facts. When you make an assumption you assume characteristics of other people without really taking the time and effort to get to know them.

  What happens when you assume ?</p>

<p>1. Assumptions inhibit you from further development, growth and keeping an open mind.</p>

<p>2.Every time you assume you narrow your thinking, you stop exploring, you stop asking questions and you may probably tend to make yourself unhappy.</p>

<p>  By making the assumptions you perceive the world by being influenced, do not limit yourself with a narrow and close minded world.

           Assumptions are made because sometimes we do not simply have credible data, complete information about the subject or deep enough a knowledge.We make up all sorts of stories in our head and then we take actions based on those stories, not based on fact!


Here is a small story of two drivers which tells us how an assumption can lead to dangerous problems. </p>

<p> One day two cars were driving very fast on some country lanes in opposite directions. The height was really very high so they couldn't see what was in the opposite directions.
     One car was driven by a man and other was driven by a women it was a hot sunny day so both of them had their windows down low, As they approached the bends they suddenly saw each other at the last minute and manged to apply the breaks they just manged to squeeze pass each other without touching paint works, at the time the women lend through her window and shouted "pig", the man as quick as a flash lend through his window and shouted "cow", the man accelerated off around the corner and crashed into a pig.
    The women was only trying to warn that there was a pig around the corner and he reacted way to quickly made a wrong assumption and crashed on to a pig.

so how often have your assumptions gone wrong ????

We all have gone away at some point on some limited information and created a whole story in our mind and tried to fill in all the gaps but the time our minds finished we turned it into our future film.This could be really dangerous.</p>
